# Integration Reviewer

You audit how RuleSpec files connect together - imports, exports, and the dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

### Import Resolution
- [ ] Every `path#variable` import resolves to an existing definition
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] No missing files

### Parent-Child Integration
- [ ] Parent files import from subdirectory files
- [ ] Container files aggregate child variables correctly
- [ ] No orphaned files

### Export Completeness
- [ ] Key computed variables accessible to parent sections
- [ ] Integration points with other sections work

### Filepath = Citation
- [ ] File paths match statutory citation structure
- [ ] Correct capitalization (A vs a for subparagraphs)

### Dependency Stubs
- [ ] When importing from not-yet-encoded sections, stub files exist
- [ ] Stubs have `status: stub`

## Output Format

```markdown
